Unlike AE paper model, the model used in the paper:
- Rep days are presented in the old format where only medoids and their weights are printed in the csv file
- Models flow in both systems as a pipe and bubble model
- No NG storage
- Only one case (last case, the original one formulated in the paper)
- NG system is planned over rep. days not full year
- No CCS costs/variables
- No unit commitement (UC)
- Only RM scenarion (BAU) is considered
- offshore wind can be built in any node not just MA and CT
- No regional cost coefficients
- No resource availibility constraint
